Augusto are one of New Zealand's most up and coming digital agencies. While
offering a wide range of creative services, they excel in creating great video
content. Word is spreading fast, and Augusto contacted Group 6 Technologies to
help them build a facility to keep up with their growing needs.

A new office for Augusto was secured at the hip new Auckland location
"Cityworks Depot", for which Group 6 then completed an extensive network
infrastructure upgrade. It was also decided Augustos editing facilities would
be upgrade to Avid MediaComposer, for which the [DIVA Media System](/diva/) was
a perfect fit for their video and graphics needs. An Oracle robotic tape
library has also been installed to ensure all current content is backed up, and
long term archives are accessible and reliable.
