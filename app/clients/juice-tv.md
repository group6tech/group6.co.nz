When Juice Television decided to move away from traditional manned on air suites to a fully automated digital broadcast system in 2003 they called in Group 6 Technologies to manage the transition and create the vital new software needed to integrate their new systems.

Faced with the issue of creating New Zealand’s first fully automated digital multi-channel station with a limited budget, tight deadlines, and no existing design plans, the team at Group 6 knew they had a challenge on their hands.

With a marathon effort, Group 6 completed the construction and integration of the new CAR and cine tape facilities to meet the on-air deadlines. Custom software was then developed by Group 6 to automate the on-air graphics presence for Juice TV’s two 24 hour music channels, facilitating autonomous control from the NControl automation system to the Dekocast graphics servers.

To create a complete end to end automation system, an on-air file management system was needed. Not finding anything on the market that suited Juice’s unique needs Group 6 created this final piece of software to complete the automation chain, that fitted within Juice TV’s demanding budget and time constraints.

This was followed by the completion of a new multi-camera studio and post production facilities, all integrated directly to the on-air platform, as well as undertaking a complete IT upgrade for the facility.

The result was a successful transition from manned to fully automated on air suites. A move that has since been replicated by some of New Zealand’s largest broadcasters.
