Television talent quest sensation New Zealandâ€™s Got Talent is filmed without the luxury of time, but has to achieve glossy polished production standards.

Group 6 were engaged to develop and manage the media workflow from shooting on location, to going into post, being on air within three days.

During production we provided on-site technical support, and were able to identify slow downs and points of failure in the workflows, and wrote custom software to speed up and manage the delivery of the footage with better feedback and control over the process.
