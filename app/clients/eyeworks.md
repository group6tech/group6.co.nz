After a hugely successful first season of The Block NZ for Eyeworks, it was an easy decision to commission a second season. To step up the game, Eyeworks selected a new file based camera format, as well as producing three episodes per week, all of which required extended capacity to their existing post production capacity.

With hundreds of hours of footage to ingest, and turn around for on air under tight deadlines, Eyeworks needed a proven cost effective storage solution for their reality tv troubles.

By working with Eyeworksâ€™ existing Avid Unity media network, Group 6 was able to seamlessly integrate their existing DIVA storage solution to drastically increase post production workflow capacity and efficiency. Their editors are now collaborating with media from both DIVA and Unity to produce an exceptionally high quality show multiple times per week.
