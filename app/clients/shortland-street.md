In 2010, Group 6 were contracted to complete the HD studio upgrade for New Zealandâ€™s best loved and longest-running soap Shortland Street.

The existing SD studio, control room, and audio suite was refurbished and integrated with a new HD central apparatus room and VT operating area, furthering the integration between the studio and in-house post-production facilities.

Finally, a new online suite was constructed, bring the previously out-sourced grading process on site. Shortland Street now has much better integration between studio and post. Now with a full in-house production facility they have speed up processes, minimised errors and improved quality control.
