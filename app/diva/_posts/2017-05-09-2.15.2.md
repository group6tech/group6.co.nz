Despite appearances, our developers haven't created an amazing new middle
out compression algorithm and quartered the size of all your media. No, instead
they just can't add. So we've fixed the bug where suddenly your drives
look they have a lot less used space on them.

We've also had problems with AVG wrongly accusing DIVA Client of being virus.
AVG have confirmed with us it's a false flag, as they don't automatically
trust rare files.
Unfortunately AVG deletes half the DIVA Client files and corrupts the install.
We've put a check in place to see if AVG is doing this, and preventing DIVA
Client from running.
You'll have to [configure an exception in AVG](https://support.avg.com/SupportArticleView?l=en&urlName=How-to-make-exclusions-from-all-scans-and-shields), and exclude the path
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Group 6 Technologies\*`.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Client:**
  * detect AVG when binding Win32_VolumeChangeEvent (Win)
  * check server name is set before opening dashboard (Win)
* **Node:**
  * fix drive size calculation
  * restore DIVAMount when health checking
  * handle exceptions when scanning avid media drives
