2.7.6 reports on two new events: when a users directory on a media drive is missing their MXF directory, and when the project scanning engine cannot access a user created directory.

#### Bug Fixes

 - Node: handle permission exception when background scanning projects
 - Project: report junction permission issues
 - WPF: prevent logger displaying IEventAggregator message

#### Features

 - Node: detect and report missing user MXF directory
