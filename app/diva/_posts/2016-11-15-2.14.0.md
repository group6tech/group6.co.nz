Features, features, features! Features for everyone!

How about RENAMING DRIVES?! I know, right! Made a typo? Fix it! Changed your mind? Change the name!

Or maybe some of you would like S P A C E S? That's right, SPACES in drive names! You could even rename your current drives to use spaces!

And then there's the ABSTRACTED FILESYSTEM! Yes, we've gone all Dal√≠ on your media. But since you're inside the painting, you won't even notice! But with this we can better test each new release, just like making prints instead of a whole new painting every time.

But wait, there's more!

- Background transcoded media is now shared even when Media Composer doesn't move it.
- You can schedule health checks for [when all users unmount the drive](http://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/drives.htm#health), or during a [maintenance window](http://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/events.htm#maintenance_window)
- [The dashboard shows you disk usage over all your nodes](http://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/#dashboard)
- [Customise the separator in drive set names](http://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/drives.htm#separator)

And we went through about five cases of bug spray. Gross.

Since this is a fairly hefty release, it's going to require some reboots on the nodes, and updates to the clients, so we'll be reaching out to everyone soon to schedule an update.
