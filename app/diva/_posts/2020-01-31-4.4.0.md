They say removing code is a good thing, and we've done just that with the first release of the year.
After looking at the usage details we no longer support quotas on drives.
This removes a lot of legacy code and development headaches for something that was practically un-used.

We have also changed the auditing system to automatically remove records after two months.
This is to prevent excessive database growth at high usage sites.
If you require longer data retention you can this under System/Settings/Logs on the dashboard.
