Today's release ensures that all drives are un-mounted when quitting the Mac client.
We've also disable the quit prompt on the clients if you're not signed in.

Otherwise we have a number of small fixes to make the API between DIVA Client and Fusion more stable.

#### Features

- **Client**:
  - do not prompt to exit when not signed in (Mac)
  - do not prompt to exit when not signed in (Win)
- **Node**:
  - disable updates if started with --debug
  - debugging option
  - change window title to DIVA Node
- **Server**:
  - change window title to DIVA Server
  - improve event reporting diagnostics

#### Bug Fixes

- **Client**:
  - correctly set button states when update is available (Mac)
  - drives not un-mounting on exit (Mac)
- **Events**: null check BaseIncident noun
- **Fusion**:
  - flag user as seen before enumerating messages
  - retrieve Node directly for client api drives
- **Node**:
  - don't scan drive if not correctly bound from api
  - null argument check drive properties when initialising
  - handle unobserved task exceptions
  - null check DirectoryException path parameter
  - incorrect error when sharing project which no longer exists
  - prevent access to OMFI databases for non-media drives
  - convert BaseIncident magic properties to methods
- **Server**:
  - event noun not being recorded
  - NodeIpConflict event incorrect resource case
  - prevent failed jobs being reported twice
