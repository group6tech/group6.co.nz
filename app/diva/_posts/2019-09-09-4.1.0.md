v4.1.0 introduces audit logging, where we record what users complete what actions and at what time.
E.g. UserA gave UserB read access to DriveC at time X.
For now it's just recorded in the database, and we'll be adding a way to view this information in the future.
We can access the data directly in the database for now if you need to know anything.

We've also added a new feature to DIVA Client where you can choose to automatically re-mount the last drives you were using.
This will even follow you between edit suites.
You can enable this option by clicking your username, then Preferences, then checking the **Remount drives** option.
