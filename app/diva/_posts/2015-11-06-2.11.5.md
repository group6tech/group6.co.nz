Now that OS X 10.11 El Capitan is out, as well as DAVE 13, there's been some
changes in the way that OS X mounts drives. Please note that Avid Media Composer
**DOES NOT** officially support OS X 10.11 yet!

#### Features

- **Client**:
  - optionally disable updates for testing (Mac)
  - support for DAVE 13 and OS X 10.11 (Mac)

#### Bug Fixes

- **Client**: don't prompt to close if system shutting down (Mac)
- **Events**: only report volume offline after more than one occurrence
- **Fusion**:
  - validate drive set name length
  - throw http error if issue retrieving drives for client
- **Node**: handle UnauthorizedAccessException while reporting volumes
