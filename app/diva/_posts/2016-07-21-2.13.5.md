Today we've got a maintenance release to address to a few annoying bugs, primarily to get notification emails working again. Our email provider made a change to their API, which we only just caught.

We've also fixed enabling and disabling drives from Fusion. And we caught Basic drives getting the wrong permissions when created as part of a set.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Client**: ninject exception reporting binding (Win)
- **Events**: campaign monitor sender address api error
- **Fusion**:
  - null exception when generating job breadcrumbs
  - basic drive permissions not correctly set to read when creating drive set
  - can't disable/enable drives
- **Node**: job failure exception reporting

#### Features
- **Events**: provide additional email detail
- **Fusion**: remove sender address from initial setup and setup
- **Node**: disable auto-update with --no-update argument
