Ho ho ho. The most noticeable fix today is client's were sometimes not getting notified when a new drive set was made available.
We're also continuing to improve reporting and error handling as we transition more background services to SignalR.

#### Features

* **Fusion:** improve errors during drive request from client

#### Bug Fixes

* **Client:** log error retrieving drive after access changed
* **Fusion:**
  * commit set roles before notifying SignalR
  * node SignalR test interface authentication
  * SignalR error pipeline module
* **Incidents:** only report SignalR offline if ongoing for more than 1 minute
* **Node:**
  * handle IO exception moving media folder on DIVAFS drive
  * handle SignalR connection remote name not resolved
  * handle SignalR connection error to unreachable host
  * handle SignalR 400 connection exception
  * handle SignalR connection is in the disconnected state error
