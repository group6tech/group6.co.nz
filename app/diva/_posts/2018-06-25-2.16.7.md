A late Monday release to address some edge case issues a few customers have noticed.
We've also introduced the ability to run specific backup maintenance tasks on demand.

#### Features

* **Fusion:**
  * enable bundle optimisation
  * prevent non-project drives being created on volumes flagged for projects
* **Incidents:** record AggregateException via ErrorCollector
* **Installer:** abort on database update failure
* **Server:**
  * --debug flag
  * synchronise database with B2 on demand
  * recalculate backup statistics on demand
  * consolidate backup versions on demand
  * run all backup cleanup tasks on demand
  * clean up backup database records on demand
  * delete old backup files on demand
  * prune backup versions on demand



#### Bug Fixes

* **Backup:**
  * handle transport connection closed during upload
  * check for nested B2Exception when deleting version
* **DB:** DriveRole unique constraint
* **Logic:** serialize model instead of entity when reporting backup delete exception
* **Node:**
  * handle process cannot access file when deleting drive
  * don't report duplicate volumes
