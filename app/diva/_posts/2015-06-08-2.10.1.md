Small update to tidy up a few items after the 2.10 release.

The biggest change is you now cannot set a username which is the same as a Node's hostname, and vice versa, as Windows doesn't allow it.

#### Bug Fixes

* **DB:** check if database exists before checking table values
* **Fusion:**
  * prevent Node hostnames being the same as usernames
  * prevent usernames being the same as a Node hostname
  * Correctly display move media warning messages
* **Incidents:** parse object ids before using in LINQ query
* **Node:**
  * handle ComException when checking if drive is external
  * handle process access errors when sharing projects
* **Projects:** only archive user if they have files
