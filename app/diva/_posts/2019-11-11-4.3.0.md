The largest change in v4.3.0 is a full automatic update system which allows us to push updates without having to manually remote into every system.
Any pending update will be installed once all the maintenance tasks are completed, which by default runs at 1am.
You can [change the maintenance window](https://help.group6.co.nz/v4/admin/maintenance-window.html) if you wish to.
Automatic updates will be enabled by default, please contact us if you want them disabled for your site.

In DIVA Client it is now possible multi-select drives, either with the **shift** key or the **control** or **command** key (depending on if you're using Windows or macOS).
Once you've selected the drives you can then mount or un-mount that selection.
And there are two new keyboard short cuts: **control-A** to select all drives, and **control-D** to deselect all (**command-A** and **command-D** on macOS).

And amongst the bug fixes, the most important is a DIVAFS fix, where Media Composer would lock up if you selected a DIVAFS media drive as transcode target.
