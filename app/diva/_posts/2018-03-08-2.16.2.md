We've converted over the project archive system to use the same engine as the new B2 backup system. This ensures that the selected files, the output structure, and the metadata are consistant.

#### Features

* **Backup:** add zip destination
* **Client:**
  * notify when drive retrieval times out
  * add --debug and --no-update options (Win)
* **Node:** use zip backup for archives

#### Bug Fixes

* **Backup:**
  * null check file checksum exception
  * null check arguments for B2Target.CheckFilesOnDisk
  * handle unable to start backup snapshot
  * handle remote name not found
  * handle file being deleted while being backed up
* **Client:**
  * handle null response exception
  * extend API timeout for slow sites
  * handle network down in api client
* **Fusion:**
  * user drive view enum reference
  * view enum references
  * view references to G6.Models.Enums
  * handle first snapshot completed yet on dashboard
* **Logic:**
  * don't try and enable member if user isn't a member
  * handle duplicate key exception when logging computers
* **Node:**
  * handle identity not mapped
  * reduce free space requirement when archiving projects
  * skip non-user directories when archiving shared projects
* **Restore:** use version action and not file action when restoring
* **Server:** don't run backup cleanup if backup disabled
