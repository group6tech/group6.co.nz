With today's release of Avid Media Composer 8.6.1, Avid have finally moved away from the use of .avs files for managing each project's settings, and have fully committed to the .xml file format.
Part of our project detection and sharing system relied on this .avs file existing within the project folder. We've modified the system so it will now work with either a .xml or a .avs.

#### Features

* **Core:** file system abstraction
* **NodeApi:** validate project name

#### Bug Fixes

* **Node:**
  * ifilesystem binding
  * check for either avs or xml when sharing a project
* **NodeApi:**
  * specify datacontract on project model
  * allow for no avs when detecting new projects
