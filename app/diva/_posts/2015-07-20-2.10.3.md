Today we have a couple of big fixes on this maintenance release.

A number of clients had been reporting issues where on OS X they could create a new folder on a Basic drive, but immediately after could not rename or move it.
This was tracked down to Spotlight on the client attempting to index the new folder, and holding a lock on it for up to half an hour.
We're now creating a *marker file* at the root of each drive, which prevents Spotlight from indexing any DIVA drive.

We have also completely restructured how shares and permissions are handled from the Node server.
This is to address an issue where Media Composer on Windows could not access bins which were inside any sub folders.
Due to the nature of the fix required, installing this update requires a complete Health Check of all drives to recreate the share and permissions.
We will be contacting each client soon to arrange an appropriate time to deploy DIVA 2.10.3.
