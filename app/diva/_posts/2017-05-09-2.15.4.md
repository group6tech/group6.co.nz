Spring has sprung, and we have some fresh patches just for you!

One of our customers discovered a situation where media tool would report some media as being "locked" and would not let you delete it. If you come across this, you'll need to run a [health check](https://help.group6.co.nz/v2/articles/health-check-drive.html) on the drive, and still [move all the media](https://help.group6.co.nz/v2/articles/move-many-users-media.html) to the user who is trying to do the delete.

Otherwise there are just a couple of small tweaks for some one off errors we've seen reported.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Client:**
  * handle drive already manually unmounted (Win)
  * check drive list is not null before binding to view (Mac)
  * handle service unavailable response
  * handle SendFailure response error
* **FileSystem:** check source directory exists before copying
* **Fusion:** check roles are not null before returning over client api
* **Node:** permissions for media tool to delete media
