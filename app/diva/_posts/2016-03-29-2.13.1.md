Avid have recently made a change to Media Composer where to open a project, the user must have full write access to the project files.
As a result, we've decided to remove the read permission for Avid Project drives, and convert any existing read permissions to write.

#### Features

- **Node**:
  - attempt to move private Avid Bins to the users shared folder when sharing a project

#### Bug Fixes

- remove read-only option for project drives
- **Client**:
  - drives in a favourite can mount multiple times after signing out and in again (Win)
- **Events**:
  - notification emails missing source site name
- **Fusion**:
  - correctly check if drive name exists when creating set
  - convert drive set project read permissions to write
- **Node**:
  - handle directory not found while listing files
  - handle null reference when resetting read only files
  - ignore FileNotFoundException when resetting read-only files
  - reset directories separately when resetting read only files
