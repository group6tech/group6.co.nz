Some of you may have noticed that you're getting alert emails twice?
Or you just ignore them anyway?
Either way, we've stopped that annoying habit, so you'll only get a zillion instead of a bajillion emails every day now.

We've also tidied up some project export bugs for the Windows client.

And, if for some reason you have multiple .avp files in a project folder when you try and share it (WHY?), you'll get an error message that makes more sense.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Client**:
  - ignore shared.diva when exporting projects (Win)
- **Events**:
  - some recipients receive emails multiple times
- **Node**:
  - report multiple avp files in project directory as share error
- **Server**:
  - improved license handling
