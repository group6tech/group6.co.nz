We've got a big new release today.

We've overhauled the incident reporting engine, to find the best balance of knowing of the system is performing, and not being bugged with notification emails constantly.
The following events also now generating an incident which you can be notified of:

 - Failed job
 - Job running for more than 5 minutes
 - Node has gone offline
 - Node volume has disappeared
 - Node volume size has changed
 - DIVA drive has disappeared
 - Volumes larger than license allows
 - License key missing

Notifications are also sent when incidents are still occurring 30 minutes, an hour, and 6 hours later, unless you have acknowledged the incident.

There's also new tools for selecting multiple jobs at once and cancelling or retrying them.
We've also improved what the system allows in case the license USB key fails.
And there's a new flag on Avid volume types to specifically allow project drives to be created. This is to help only create project drives on the SSD rather than the media arrays.
