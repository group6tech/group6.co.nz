First patch of the new year, where we address a problem setting drive permissions.
The bug would deny access to any user who had the drive mounted while changing permissions on the drive, whoops!

#### Bug Fixes

* **Client:** handle additional connection errors
* **Fusion:** user permission wrongly set to denied when mounte
* **WPF:** check if notifcation closed before updating
