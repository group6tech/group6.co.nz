Mostly bug fixes today.
We've included the ability to delete computers from the list of edit suites so you can keep that list tidy.
Sometimes on a Mac the operating system can timeout when trying to mount a drive. The timeout duration has been reduced to 5 seconds so it doesn't appear like everything is locked.

#### Features

* **Client:** add base url to api expections
* **Fusion:** delete computer from edit suite list


#### Bug Fixes

* **Client:**
  * handle socket connection error
  * handle remote name not found
  * timeout drive mount when using AppleScript (Mac)
  * handle error writing headers
* **FileSystem:**
  * handle user no longer existing when revoking permissions
  * handle UnauthorizedAccessException when deleting directory
* **Fusion:** null check role drive before sending to client
