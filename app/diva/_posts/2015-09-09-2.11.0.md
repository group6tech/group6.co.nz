In a shocking development, the dashboard is now actually a dashboard!

![DIVA Dashboard](/images/news/diva-dashboard.png)

Live updating graphs representing the state of the jobs, nodes, drives, and events.
With a quick glance you can now easily see the health of the system.

The event system has been overhauled, with friendlier messages, and an easier to manage interface.
Notifications for on-going events are now also opt-in.

You can also now choose to disable monitoring of specific Node volumes.
This is useful for when you are often connecting and disconnecting transport drives directly to DIVA.
By disabling monitoring for those drive letters on a Node, you'll no longer get *Volume Offline* events reported.

Oh! And there's now a help button in the top right corner of Fusion and the clients, which links you directly to [help.group6.co.nz](https://help.group6.co.nz) which contains all the DIVA documentation.

And as an added bonus, clicking the DIVA icon in the DIVA Client toolbar will take you straight to the Fusion dashboard!
