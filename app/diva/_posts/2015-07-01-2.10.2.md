We recently discovered an issues where Windows users could not open bins if they were inside a subfolder. This was due to a change in the file permissions required by Media Composer on Windows.

We've re-engineered the entire permissions structure to accommodate this. In the process we've improved control over who can access and modify bins throughout a project.

#### Bug Fixes

* **Node**: ensure permissions are set correctly for all drives.
