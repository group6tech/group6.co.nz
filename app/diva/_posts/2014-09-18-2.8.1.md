Two new major features are allowing you to manage a users drive access directly
from the user management interface, and being able to type a drive quota instead
of using the slider.

#### Features
- DriveSet: remove forced hyphen separator
- Fusion:
   - manage drive permissions per user
   - allow user to type quota for drive
- Node: improve reporting around permission problems

#### Bug Fixes

- Client:
   - ensure message type before displaying message
   - check drive letter is available before mounting as 'any' drive letter
- Core: limit WPF Log control length to prevent buffer overflow
- DriveSet:
   - add roles to drive when creating set
   - ensure drive is saved before adding role when creating set
- Fusion: leave Tools directory intact when installing
- Node:
   - handle junction point access denied exceptions
   - ensure notify icon removed when closing
   - check directory exists before resetting permissions
   - ignore null sub folders when scanning MXFs
- Server: update drive size when volume size changes
