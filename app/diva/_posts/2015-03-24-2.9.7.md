We recently discovered that sub-folders within a users folder in a project did
not have the correct permissions applied, and other users could save those bins.
We've added some background processing to ensure that doesn't happen, as well
as some other small fixes around detecting new projects.

#### Features

- **Node**:
  - background reset project user subfolder permissions

#### Bug Fixes

- **Node**:
  - don't mark possible project folders which are missing avs or avp files
  - repair shared project user folder when repairing project
