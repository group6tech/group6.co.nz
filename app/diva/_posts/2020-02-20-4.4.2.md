A slew of fixes and some performance tweaks.
We've made some changes around users where all accounts will now be full members by default to avoid confusion, and as a result we've removed the Membership tab on the user management interface.
There's also some some more retries added around talking to the filesystem to avoid errors around files being in use by another process.
And if you've left Client open for over a day, and the server has rebooted during that time you may get a prompt to enter your password again, just to ensure you're still properly authenticated.
