Today weâ€™re releasing DIVA v2.5.5 which contains a number of behind the scenes
optimisations, mostly focused around ensuring project permissions are correct
when moving bins between users and unprotected.

We've also introduced a number of "Health Checks" which will force a drive into
a new maintenance mode, and ensure all folder structures and permissions are
correct. This can be executed against all drives, a single drive, or even a
single project.

You can now place any file inside the DIVA Fusion\Installs\Tools directory and
it will appear for download on the dashboard. This is the ideal place to store
the .NET and Mono framework installers, as well as any other facility specific
toolsets.

Finally there's a new "Cancel Job" button, which will prevent a queued drop
from executing, or from holding up the job queue when it's errored, but leaves
the error messages intact for us to debug for you. Please favour use of this
button over "Delete Job".
