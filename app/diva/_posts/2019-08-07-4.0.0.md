Today we release DIVA version 4, with a whole new client, including macOS 10.14 Mojave support.
You can read [more about the new client here](/news/2019/08/07/diva4.html).

The new client is the same on both macOS and Windows now.
On Mac there is a minimum system requirement of macOS 10.13.6.
If you need to run macOS 10.14 then you must also be running DIVAFS.

There is also a new licensing system, fixes for project backups, and a whole slew of other changes which make adding new features much easier going forward.
