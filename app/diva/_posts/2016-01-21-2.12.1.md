We've noticed more and more read-only files appearing on Basic drives.
These make it really hard for users to delete folders and move things around.

They're usually generated when copying an entire camera card to the drive, and
is usually a file like "Get started with GoPro.url" - Thanks, GoPro!

With v2.12.0 we made sure these read-only flags were cleared when a drive was
health checked.
Now with v2.12.1, we're also automatically removing any read-only flag on a
daily schedule at 1:00am.
