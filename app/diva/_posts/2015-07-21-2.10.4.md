A tiny fix for the Windows client.
With 2.10.3 we converted the client config from an ini file to the registry.
At one site, some suites didn't correctly copy over the configured server address, so crashed when trying to connect to nothing.
We've added an extra check to make sure the config value exists, and if not, show the user the configuration screen so they can set it.

#### Bug Fixes

- **Client**: check if server is not set and display options on load (Win)
