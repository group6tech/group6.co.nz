Version 3.0.3 fixes a few edge cases around changing drive permissions and restoring files from backup when they've been deleted.

#### Features

* **Fusion:** record drive data as parameter when sending role change
* **Server:** optionally excluded deleted versions when requesting file version

#### Bug Fixes

* **Backup:**
  * check for correct exception type when file is already hidden
  * lookup fileId when hiding file if already hidden
* **Config:** EFCodeFirst caching
* **FileSystem:**
  * attempt to delete empty directory if deleting junction
  * throw exception if parent directory of junction does not exist
* **Logic:**
  * ensure drive role data is correct when removing single user role
  * ensure drive role data is correct when changing single user role
* **Node:**
  * exclude deleted version when restoring file backup
  * ignore known folders when archiving user on project drive
  * report B2 internal incident as service offline
* **Server:** handle remote name not found getting B2 bucket list during cleanup
