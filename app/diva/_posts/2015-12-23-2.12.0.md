Introducing DIVA Focus, our new cloud central monitoring platform.
As all the system monitoring until now has been performed within the local
system, if DIVA Server went down for any reason, we wouldn't know about it
until someone called us. Now we can monitor the health of DIVA externally, and
immediately be informed if anything is wrong.

We'll also be opening up DIVA Focus to all our users next year, so you can sign
in and see the health of your system, update your contact details, and view
your support status.

Also in this release we have a completely reworked job engine, which lowers the
system resources required on each Node, as well as improving reliability and
performance.
