There is now a number of different states for a drive, which is reflected in the Client. For example if a Node goes offline, then the drive will display as 'Node Offline' in the Client, and prevent a user from attempted to mount it.

A maintenance task can also be run against a drive, which ensures the structure is as it should be.

#### Bug Fixes

 - Client:
   - installer sets correct permissions for Windows 8 (Win)
   - correct drive names for 10.9 (OS X)
   - download updates to user writable path (OS X)
   - clear pending update if installer not found (OS X)
   - check for update as soon as server hostname is known (OS X)
   - handle null references when closing (OS X)
 - Drive:
   - ensure drive is flagged online after maintenance fails
   - mark drive online at creation so users can be assigned
 - Fusion:
   - colour code drive status labels
   - report build number for mac client updates
   - job log not displaying completed date
   - allow drive permission edit for all drive states except maintenance
   - drive edit javascript for new DriveType enum values
   - job pending filter
   - fix remove volume interface
   - hide add volume if no volumes available
   - do not accept quota if volume doesn't support quotas
 - Installer: ensure old application updates are removed
 - Job: job created/modified details not set when sending to all nodes
 - Node:
   - ignore client api exceptions when disconnecting
   - ignore missing directories in background permissions check
   - prevent double disconnection call when closing window
   - allow drive maintenance to run when drive is already flagged in maintenance
   - handle file not found while resetting permissions
   - improved deleting of drives
   - mute reporting of concurrent connection errors
   - handle null drive reference while drive is offline
   - handle file being (re)moved while cleaning permissions
 - Server: ensure new node volumes are associated with node

#### Features

 - Client:
   - show drive status (Win)
   - show drive status (OS X)
   - show new version in update prompt (Win)
 - Fusion:
   - improved real-time drive list and filter
   - display drive status on edit interface
   - automatically refresh job list every 5 seconds
 - Node:
   - mark node drives off/online with node presence
   - webapi communication interface

#### Breaking Changes

To ensure that software patches are saved to a local writable directory, the path where the configuration is stored has also been changed. This means that all existing server and 'remember me' login credentials have been reset and will need to be re-entered.
