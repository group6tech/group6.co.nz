DIVA v2.13.0 introduces **External Drives** - this allows you to add remote network
shares and FTP servers as DIVA Drives, which your editors can then easily mount
in the suite. They can even be added to favourites!
We've added to the [help documentation](https://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/drives.htm#addexternal)
how to add an external drive, as well as a [walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_CXPi8bO_c).

There's a few bug fixes in there as well, most importantly fixing an issue
changing a users drive access from read to write.
We've also had to change our email notification provider, due to third party
changes.

* **Jobs:**
  * use error codes when adding user to project
