No new features right now, following the big 3.0 release, but a few fixes.

Fixed a good one on Windows where if you had mapped a network drive outside of DIVA,
but it hadn't mounted yet, the drive letter would kinda be in use, kinda not, and
DIVA Client would throw an error if tried to use that drive letter.
