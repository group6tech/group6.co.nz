Say hello to [forums.group6.co.nz](https://forums.group6.co.nz/), our new Discourse fourm. Over there we'll have release news for DIVA, channels for bug reports and feature requests, and general #postchat.
We'll see how it gets used over the next while and adapt as we go.

You'll find the link in the footer of the website, and the footer of the [DIVA release emails](https://www.group6.co.nz/diva/#subscribe).

[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) is a open source forum platform, built to bring civilzied discussion for your community.
