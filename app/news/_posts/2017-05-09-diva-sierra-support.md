DIVA 2.15.0 is now available, with support for macOS 10.12 Sierra, improved drive mounting on macOS, and a better project archiving system.

The updated DIVA Client for macOS now works with 10.12 Sierra, and is faster and more reliable mounting and unmounting drives on the desktop.
As part of these changes, we've incorporated a "legacy" mode for mounting drives.
This may be usefull if you're using [Network Drives](https://help.group6.co.nz/v2/articles/about-client-drives.html) with custom names.
[Instructions](http://help.group6.co.nz/v2/articles/client-legacy-mode.html) are availble for changing between AppleScript drive mounting and Legacy drive mounting.

Our new project archiving system makes it much faster to collect an entire copy of all the Avid project files for a specific project - or even a drive of projects.

Check out the demo for archiving projects below.
