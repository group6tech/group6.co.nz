Today we are releasing DIVA v4, with a new cross platform client and full support for macOS 10.14 Mojave.

After a long gestation and many months of private testing, we're proud to introduce our new cross platform client.

Our new tooling allows for a consistent experience across platforms, and means we can introduce new features on a faster basis.

The new client has a minimum requirement of macOS 10.13.6 on the Apple side, and Windows 10 1803.
If you need to run macOS 10.14 Mojave then you will also have to be running DIVAFS for full Avid Media Composer support.
The older client is still available for older platforms, though it will not be receiving any further updates.

We'll be rolling out the update over the next week or so, but please contact us if you're keen for the new client.
