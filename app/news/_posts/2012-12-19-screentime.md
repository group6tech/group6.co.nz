[Screentime](http://www.screentime.co.nz/), producers of shows such as Police
Ten 7 and Underbelly NZ, have just commissioned a major post-production and IT
upgrade, having chosen Group 6 Technologies as their partner.

We have completed a complete infrastructure overhaul, upgrading seven of their
existing edit suites, and replacing two of them. They have also chosen to
replace their previous shared storage with a DIVA media platform, including both
Avid and raw file-storage servers, as well as an LTO archiving solution.

Group 6 have also partnered with Parnell based Apple specialists
[Ubertec](http://ubertec.co.nz/), who are providing IT support. Together, Group
6 and Ubertec are providing continuous on-call support and facilities
maintenance.
