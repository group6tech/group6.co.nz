South Pacific Pictures have upgraded their camera chains in their Shortland
Street studios, with three new Panasonic VariCam 35 4K cameras. Two additional
cameras were also purchased for use in the field.

Group 6 were contracted to complete the final integration, using MultiDyne
SilverBack studio transceivers, and the existing fibre camera cables,
integrating with the studio control rooms systems Group 6 upgraded in 2011.

The PCR rack recieved a major overhaul, connecting the new base stations with
the existing vision mixer, coms, tally, and video distribution systems.
Group 6 also completed custom integration of the video return system, between
the new camera backs and existing zoom demands, with new Canon lenses.
