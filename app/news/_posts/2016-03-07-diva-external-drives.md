DIVA v2.13.0, [released today](/diva/2016/03/07/2.13.0.html), adds a new feature we're calling **External Drives**.
This allows you to add non-DIVA network shares, and remote FTP servers, as drives within DIVA, which can be mounted using DIVA Client. They can even be added to favourites, making them even easier for editors to use in their suites.

Be it a network share on a production or IT server, within your network, or a FTP server to upload review videos, accessing them on your desktop is now just a drive mount away.

The [DIVA Help Center](http://help.group6.co.nz/fusion/drives.htm#addexternal) has instructions for adding an external drive, and we've even got a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_CXPi8bO_c) to walk you through the steps.
Since OS X and Windows doesn't have native desktop FTP support, we've also got some recommendations for using FTP on [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xN0Ma6wZSo) and [OS X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rncVHus8iSo).
