We're delighted to introduce Josh Reardon, our new technical support engineer.

A graduate from South Seas Film & Television school in 2013 specialising in Post Production, he has since been working with Imagination Television in a DIT and post support role on the TVNZ show My Kitchen Rules New Zealand.

Josh will be providing front-line support for the DIVA Media System, while building and configuring new systems.
