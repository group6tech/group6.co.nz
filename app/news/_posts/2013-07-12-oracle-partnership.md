We’re proud to announce we’re working with [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/) to
create a cost effective, powerful, and advanced backup and archiving system for
users of [DIVA](/diva/). Linear Tape File Systems will be integrated directly
with DIVA eliminating the need for an additional archiving interface. Users will
be able to search, store, backup and restore projects with a click. Oracle will
be providing direct technical support.

We have already deployed a working solution for
[Department of Post](http://departmentofpost.com/)
using a
[StorageTek SL150 Modular Tape Library](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/tape-storage/sl150-modular-tape-library/overview/index.html),
which Oracle have highlighted as a customer success story.

[Department of Post Accelerates Restore and Write Speeds by 125% and Creates Archives 3x Faster with Modular Tape Storage](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/customers/customersearch/department-of-post-1-storagetek-ss-1969891.html)
