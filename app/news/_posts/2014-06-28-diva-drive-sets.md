Often when setting up for a new project you need one of everything: a media, project, and file drive, and you'll create them using the name of your new project, and append the drive type, e.g. MyProject-Media, MyProject-Projects, etc. Then you've got to add all the users to each drive, and maybe create a favourite for all this.

Introducing Drive Sets, which allows you to complete all this from a single interface.

Just by clicking **New Drive Set** from the Drives manager you can now set a base name, choose what drives you want to create, check to add them to a favourite, and assign all your user permissions in one simple interface.

We've suggested some defaults for the drive suffix but this can be overridden all in the same interface.

Hit **Create Drive Set** and all the hard work is done for you, and all your new drives will be ready to mount in moments!
