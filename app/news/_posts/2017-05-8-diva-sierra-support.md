DIVA 2.15.0 is now available, with support for macOS 10.12 Sierra, improved drive mounting on macOS, and a better project archiving system.

The updated DIVA Client for macOS now works with 10.12 Sierra, and is faster and more reliable mounting and unmounting drives on the desktop.

Our new project archiving system makes it much faster to collect an entire copy of all the Avid project files for a specific project - or even a drive of projects.

Check out the demo for archiving projects below.
